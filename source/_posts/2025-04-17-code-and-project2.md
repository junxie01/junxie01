1. [Fast analysis of the seismic rupture](https://ssa2py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_info.html) SSA2py is an emergent python based software that allows fast analysis of the seismic rupture, making possible the near-realtime identification of the rupture characteristics after a significant seismic event. 
2. [Fast matching filter](https://github.com/beridel/fast_matched_filter) Seismic matched-filter search for both CPU and GPU architectures.
3. [MUSIC Teleseismic Back-Projection](https://github.com/lsmeng/MUSICBP) Perform the Back-Projection Imaging on the seismograms of large earthquakes recorded by large-scale dense arrays.
4. [Seismic_BPMF](https://ebeauce.github.io/Seismic_BPMF/index.html) Fully automated workflow for earthquake detection and location with the backprojection and matched filtering methods.
5. [ARRU_seismic_backprojection](https://github.com/tso1257771/Attention-Recurrent-Residual-U-Net-for-earthquake-detection) ARRU Phase Picker: Attention Recurrent‐Residual U‐Net for Picking Seismic P‐ and S‐Phase Arrivals.
6. [earthquake_back_projection](https://github.com/ajay6763/earthquake_back_projection) Back-projection of high-frequency radiation from earthquake source using multiple arrays. Methodology is based on Ishii (2012). 
7. [earthquake_detection](https://github.com/ebeauce/earthquake_detection_EB_et_al_2019) Codes used in the earthquake detection and location method presented in Beauce et al. 2019, DOI: 10.1029/2019JB018110. A real data example is also provided.
8. [beampower](https://ebeauce.github.io/beampower/introduction.html) Fast routines for seismic backprojection/beamforming for both CPU and GPU architectures.
9. [Iterative Linear Stress Inversion (ILSI)](https://ebeauce.github.io/ILSI/) Python package for stress tensor inversion. 
10. [Pyrocko](https://git.pyrocko.org/pyrocko/pyrocko/) A Python framework for efficient use of pre-computed Green's functions in seismological and other physical forward and inverse source problems.
